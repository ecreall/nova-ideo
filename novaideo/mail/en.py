Dear,


We thank you for your interest in Nova-Ideo.

{recipient_first_name} your are invited to join the the Nova-Ideo participatory platform as the site administrator.

In order to validate your invitation, you must click on the following link {invitation_url} and follow the instructions.

We remind you that Nova-Ideo is an on-line participatory innovation solution, which addresses the following problems:
- you want to implement a participatory innovation solution;
- you already have an "ideas box", and it is either empty, or so full that it is impossible to find the good ideas;
- you have no time to manage ideas. Thereby, you miss many opportunities, and create disappointment among those who have good ideas.

With Nova-Ideo, you will: collect the ideas of a set of people, find the good ones and transform them into implementable proposals that reflect all points of view.

To do so, Nova-Ideo uses crowdsourcing, by having the "crowd" to work on the transformation of ideas into full proposals.

Nova-Ideo merges the best of the "ideas box", of the collaborative portal, and of internal communication tools. It proposes cutting-edge social innovation solutions such as the majority judgement or the management of the rarity of supports/rejections.
